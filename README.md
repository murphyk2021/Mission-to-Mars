# Module 10 - Mission to Mars
## Web Scraping with HTML/CSS
---
### Overview
In this module we began applying our knowledge from the previous modules to scrape data from webpages and display it on our own!  This proved to be a convenient way to keep up to date with all of the latest news about mars from out favorite websites.  

To achieve this we used Splinter to access our favorite mars websites, Beautiful Soup to parse and extract the information we wanted, MongoDB to store the data, and bootstrap HTML to format and build our webpage.
